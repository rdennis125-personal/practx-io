        <article class="card">
          <h3>Practice Management</h3>
          <p>We help dental teams simplify operations and elevate patient care. From streamlined administrative tools to integrated support systems, Practx brings together everything a practice needs to stay organized, compliant, and efficient — so teams can focus less on tasks and more on treatment.</p>

          <h3>Equipment Management</h3>
          <p>Practx empowers practices to take control of their equipment lifecycle. We help extend the life of every investment through smarter tracking, preventive maintenance, and on-demand support — ensuring every operatory runs as reliably as the people behind it.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Patient Outreach</h3>
          <p>Healthy habits start between appointments. Practx helps practices stay connected with patients through personalized engagement and preventive care initiatives that strengthen relationships and inspire consistency. Every message, every kit, every reminder — designed to make care feel personal again.</p>

          <h3>Access Expansion</h3>
          <p>Practx believes oral health should meet people where they are. Through new care models, technology-driven partnerships, and community-based initiatives, we’re reimagining how and where patients receive care — extending access, expanding opportunity, and empowering providers to reach beyond the traditional operatory.</p>

        <article class="card">
          <h3>Local Support</h3>
          <p>Our service franchise model keeps every practice ready to serve through next-day repairs, preventative maintenance, and on-demand expertise.
